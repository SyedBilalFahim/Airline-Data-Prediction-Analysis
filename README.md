# Airline Ontime Performance Analysis
Wonder question: Have you ever been stuck in an airport because your flight was  delayed or canceled and wondered if you could have predicted it if you'd had  more data? Problem Type: Since we are interested in the arrival delay in minutes, we will use  regression to predict the arrival delay which may be caused due to some  underlying factors like if there is a delay in departure of flight than it may have  arrival delay too etc.

Questions To Answer:
1. When is the best time of day, day of the week, and time of year to fly to minimise delays?
2. Do older planes suffer more delays?
3. How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
4. Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others?
5. Use the available variables to construct a model that predicts delays.
