# Airline-Data-Prediction-Analysis
Wonder question: Have you ever been stuck in an airport because your flight was  delayed or canceled and wondered if you could have predicted it if you'd had  more data? Problem Type: Since we are interested in the arrival delay in minutes, we will use  regression to predict the arrival delay which may be caused due to some  underlying factors like if there is a delay in departure of flight than it may have  arrival delay too etc.
